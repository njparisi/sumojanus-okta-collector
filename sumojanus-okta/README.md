# SumoJanus

SumoJanus is an OSGI-based framework to run different integrations or collections between SumoLogic and other platforms. Each of this integration is implemented in the form of an OSGI bundle.

## Structuture

Below are the folders of the package:
    + *sumo-bundle*: contains integration bundles.
    + *bundle*: contains system bundles that come with SumoJanus 2.0 or later.
    + *data*: contains files generated by the integration bundles.
    + *bin*: contains wrapper scripts for the integration bundles.

For example, the Salesforce integration package comes with these files: wrapper script `bin/SumoJanus_SF.bash` and bundle `SalesforceCollector-<version>.jar`
